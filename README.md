# PROJECT ZERO - READ ME

### Member

### Project

This project and this repo si about creating a brand new website from scratch and using HTML, CSS. This will be perfect in order to memorize and maintain my skills in coding while learning new things _@BeCode_. This will help me to keep a "trace" of my evolution from a caveman to Charles Xavier. This is also the project I'll present in order the get badges.

I'm using the Terminal and Git to manage my work and to edit my files I'm using VS Code. I've add some addons to help through the process of creation :

- Auto Rename Tag
- Community Material Theme
- Css Peek
- Live Sass Compiler
- Live Server
- Material Icon Theme
- Prettier - Code Formatter
- Sass

### Deadline

There is actually no deadline because it's all about working, learning, fixing, discovering new topics, things, way to achieve my coding's goal. It will help me to memorize and exercices.

### Employment?

I'm at home learning thanks to BeCode. I'm a new learner to become a Junior Web Developer. This is for sure something that will change my life.

### Prototype

Status : Gathering ideas.
